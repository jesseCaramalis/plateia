# Plateia
Plateia is a fullstack social media application with users, posts, friends and more. I built this app out as a way to practice my skills in React, using industry standards for project structure and code formatting.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, React-Redux + Toolkit

The backend is built in Node.js using Express, with MongoDB as a database. File uploads are stored locally using multer, whereas user and post information is stored on the database. Bcrypt and JWT are used in authentication 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
