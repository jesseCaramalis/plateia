# Plateia
Plateia is a fullstack social media application with users, posts, friends and more. I built this app out as a way to practice my skills in React, using industry standards for project structure and code formatting.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, React-Redux + Toolkit

The backend is built in Node.js using Express and MongoDB. File uploads are stored locally using multer, whereas user and post information is stored on the database. JWT with helmet for HTML headers are used in authentication, with bcrypt for password hashing.

The frontend is built with React, using Redux, Redux Toolkit and Persist for state management. This combination is frequently used in real world production of React applications. Material UI was used for all theming and UI components.
Best practices such as scenes components for different pages, functional components and incorporating all CSS in the JSX were used to best represent a production application. The finished product is maintainable and scalable, with comments highlighting various design decision and reasoning behind.
